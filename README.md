## Overview
This project is an attempt to adapt Deep Q-Learning, as described in [Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.5602v1.pdf) by Mnih et al, for 3D Tictactoe

## Installation Dependencies
* Python 2.7 or 3.5
* TensorFlow 0.10

## TODOS:
~~* Enumerate best states for 2D tictactoe using minimax

* Implement q learning for 2D tictactoe

* Extend minimax and q learning for 3D tictactoe and see what breaks

* Establish reward rubrics and input format for 3D tictactoe DQN pipeline

* Explore optimisation techniques for tree search of 3D tictactoe search space

* Design model pipeline for DQN

* Experiment with model architecture to improve performance
